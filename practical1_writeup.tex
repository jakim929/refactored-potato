\section{Technical Approach}
Throughout this process, we measured a rough estimate We started off trying several different models:\\We tried LASSO regression because we suspected the resulting weight matrix would be sparse (probably not all of the 257 provided features are useful in predicting the HOMO-LUMO gap).

bagging and boosting techniques with linear regression, attempting to decrease variance in the models and potentially decrease generalized error. However, this did not result in significantly less error when we tested it against the test set. We tried boosting and bagging with many different models. We tried including linear regression, lasso regression (because we suspected that the the resulting weight matrix would be sparse), ridge regression, but all of them yielded similar error values to linear regression.

Because we were not making headway along this
